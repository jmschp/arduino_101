### Microcontroller vs. Microprocessor

#### Microcontroller

A microcontroller is an integrated circuit designed to perform specific tasks. It includes a processor, memory, and input/output (I/O) peripherals all on a single chip. Commonly used in embedded systems for specific control applications such as appliances, automotive systems, medical devices, and hobbyist projects like those built with Arduino. In the case of the original Arduino Uno R3 we can replace the replace the microcontroller if it gets damaged, other Arduino Uno R3 compatible boards come with an soldered microcontroller that can not be changed.

Components:

- Processor (CPU): The brain of the microcontroller, executing instructions.
- Memory:
  - RAM: Temporary storage for data currently being used.
  - Flash memory: Non-volatile memory used to store the program (code).
  - EEPROM: Non-volatile memory used to store data that must be preserved between reboots.
- I/O Peripherals: GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins, timers, analog-to-digital converters (ADC), etc.

#### Microprocessor

A microprocessor is a general-purpose processing unit that requires external components (like memory and I/O peripherals) to function. It's essentially the CPU of a computer. Used in personal computers, laptops, smartphones, and servers where complex processing and high performance are required.

Components:

- Processor (CPU): Executes instructions and processes data.
- External Components Needed:
  - RAM: External random-access memory.
  - Storage: External non-volatile memory for storage (e.g., SSD, HDD).
  - I/O Controllers: Separate chips or integrated circuits for managing input and output devices.

[Getting Started with Arduino](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/getting-started-arduino/)

### General Purpose Digital and Analog Input/Output Pins

#### Digital Pins

The Arduino Uno R3 has 14 digital I/O (input/output) pins, numbered from 0 to 13, located in the long header. These pins can be configured as either inputs or outputs. Being digital we can set the output of these pins to either **HIGH** or **LOW**. It is worth noting that the Analog pins can also be treated as Digital Pins.

- **HIGH**: Sets the pin to 5V (range 3.5V to 5V) (on a 5V Arduino board), which is equivalent to a logical 1.
- **LOW**: Sets the pin to 0V (range 0V to 3.0V), which is equivalent to a logical 0.

[Arduino Digital Pins](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/digital-pins/)

#### Digital Output Pin

We can use a digital pin as output to control an external sensor, like for example a LED. Suppose we have an LED connected to digital pin 7, and ground (GND). When we set D7 to **HIGH** this should turn one the LED, when we set it to **LOW** this should turn off the LED, so we have the possible outcomes:

| D7   | Voltage | LED |
| ---- | ------- | --- |
| HIGH | 5       | ON  |
| LOW  | 0       | OFF |

![LED Digital Output LED](./images/digital_output_led.png)

[Tinkercad Digital Output LED](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/1O5evffVupm-digital-output-led?sharecode=W9E_QD0UfJqQb_yc3fvHpQbFKt0R4mMAdd-U9MD6K7I)

#### Digital Input Pin

We can also use the digital pins to receive an input, **HIGH** or **LOW** from an external sensor like a button.

In the following schematics we use a push-button to receive an input in Digital Pin 5. To avoid a Floating or Hanging value (when the state of the digital input is not specified), we need to ad a Pull-up or Pull-down resistor.

More on [Floating ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_ground) and [Pull-up and Pull-down resistors](https://techexplorations.com/blog/electronics/blog-what-are-pull-up-and-pull-down-resistors/).

- **Pull-up resistor**:
  - When the **button is not pressed** current flows from **5V Pin** to **Digital Pin 5** with the resistor, so **Digital Pin 5** as a **HIGH** value.
  - When the **button is pressed**, **Digital Pin 5** as a **LOW** value, coming from **GND Pin**, current is not able to flow from **5V Pin** to **Digital Pin 5** due to higher resistance.

| Button    | D5   |
| --------- | ---- |
| Unpressed | HIGH |
| Pressed   | LOW  |

![Digital Input Button Pull-up resistor](./images/digital_input_button_pull_up_resistor.png)

[Tinkercad Digital Input Button Pull-up resistor](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/4MaUEItR2Ej-digital-input-button-pull-up-resistor?sharecode=TK0xnTVVXEglhikOcDwrLlz27E5Ef8HxLA1ax_gbmfo)

- **Pull-down resistor**:
  - When the **button is not pressed**, **Digital Pin 5** as a clear **LOW** value from **GND Pin**.
  - When the **button is pressed** current flows through it from **5V Pin**, and **Digital Pin 5** as a **HIGH** value. because it has less resistance.

| Button    | D5   | LED |
| --------- | ---- | --- |
| Unpressed | LOW  | ON  |
| Pressed   | HIGH | OFF |

#### Analog Output (PWM) Pins

Although the Arduino Uno does not have true analog output pins, it can simulate analog output using [Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/analog-output/) on certain digital pins (not the analog pins directly). The PWM functionality is available on digital pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. PWM simulates an analog signal by rapidly switching the pin between HIGH and LOW states, creating an average voltage that can be varied by changing the duty cycle of the PWM signal. In Arduino PWM values range from 0 to 255.

Use cases:

- Dimming LEDs: Adjusting the brightness of LEDs.
- Motor Control: Controlling the speed of motors.
- Analog Voltage: Simulating varying voltage levels to other components that require an analog signal.

With an LED use case we could have the following:

| PWM | LED   | britenses |
| --: | ----- | --------- |
|   0 | off   | N/A       |
| 255 | off   | brighter  |
|  20 | off   | faint     |
| 200 | 0 off | bright    |

#### Analog Input Pins

The Arduino Uno R3 has 6 analog input pins, labeled A0 to A5. The analog input pins are used to read analog signals from sensors or other input devices. They can read voltages in the range of 0 to 5V. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) converts the analog voltage into a 10-bit digital value, ranging from 0 to 1023, 0 corresponds to 0V and 1023 corresponds to 5V.

|   V | Digital |
| --: | ------- |
|   0 | 0       |
|   5 | 1023    |

- [Arduino Analog Input Pins](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/analog-input/)
- [Arduino Calibrate Sensor Input](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/analog/Calibration/)

Use Cases:

- Sensors: Reading values from analog sensors like temperature sensors (LM35), light sensors (photocells), potentiometers, etc.
- Variable Inputs: Any variable input that changes voltage over time can be read using these pins.

### Communication

The Arduino Uno R3 board implement 3 [communications protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol) that allow it to communicate with more sophisticated sensor like GPS, a 3-axis accelerometer, or even other Arduino boards or a computer.

## Arduino IDE code

The Arduino [language](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/) is based on **C++**, and it is designed to be user friendly to beginner users. We can use the [Arduino IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/the-arduino-software-ide/) to create [Arduino Sketches](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/programming/sketches/), which are just a texts files with some Arduino program that we can compile and upload to the board, using the Arduino IDE, the extension of the files is `.ino`.

There are two main [components (functions)](<https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/programming/sketches#:~:text=setup()%20and%20loop()>) that are mandatory in every Arduino sketch, `setup()` and `loop()`:

- `setup()`: It is called once, when the sketch starts. It is where we should setup pin modes and initialize libraries, or any other task that need to run once.
- `loop()`: It is called over and over while the board is running. It is where we read data from sensor and output data to sensors.

### Some sample Sketches

#### Controlling an LED with a push-button (pull-down resistor)

We set Digital Pin 7 as output for the LED, and Digital Pin 5 as input from the push-button.

```c++
const int ledOutputPin = 7;
const int buttonInputPin = 5;

void setup() {
  pinMode(buttonInputPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(ledOutputPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(ledOutputPin, digitalRead(buttonInputPin));
}
```

[Tinkercad Digital Input Button Pull Down Resistor](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/doukbpoqPSL-digital-input-button-pull-down-resistor)

#### Using 3 potentiometer to control and RGB LED

In the global scope we first assign constants to each pin we need. Pins A0, A1 and A2 will be the analog inputs from the potentiometers wipers, then Digital Pins 3, 5, 6, will act as PWM pins for output to the RGB LED.

In the `loop` we read what is the value of each potentiometer, with `analogRead`, then `map` the value, which is an integer from 0 to 1023, to the value supported by the PWM pins, which is between 0 and 255. Finally we output the read value to each color pin of the RGB LED with `analogWrite`.

```c++
const int redPotentiometerPin = A0;
const int greenPotentiometerPin = A1;
const int bluePotentiometerPin = A2;

const int redLedPin = 3;
const int greenLedPin = 5;
const int blueLedPin = 6;

void setup() {
  pinMode(redLedPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(greenLedPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(blueLedPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int redPotentiometerVal = analogRead(redPotentiometerPin);
  int greenPotentiometerVal = analogRead(greenPotentiometerPin);
  int bluePotentiometerVal = analogRead(bluePotentiometerPin);

  long redLedVal = map(redPotentiometerVal, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
  long greenLedVal = map(greenPotentiometerVal, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
  long blueLedVal = map(bluePotentiometerVal, 0, 1023, 0, 255);

  analogWrite(redLedPin, redLedVal);
  analogWrite(greenLedPin, greenLedVal);
  analogWrite(blueLedPin, blueLedVal);
}
```

[Tinkercad Potentiometers RGB LED](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/blFnvm6MEm5-potentiometers-rgb-led)

#### Using a photoresistor to control an LED

We initialize two constants, an Analog Input **A0** to read the value from our **Voltage Divider** circuit and **Digital Pin 9**, to power up the LED. During setup we set **Digital Pin 9** as output. In the loop we read the value from **Voltage Divider** circuit with the photoresistor, we map this value to a digital value between 0 and 255, and also apply a [constrain](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/math/constrain/) since the [map](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/math/map#:~:text=Does%20not%20constrain%20values%20to%20within%20the%20range%2C%20because%20out%2Dof%2Drange%20values%20are%20sometimes%20intended%20and%20useful) function does not constrain values to within the range.

```c++
const int photoresistorInputPin = A0;
const int ledOutputPin = 9;

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledOutputPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(photoresistorInputPin);
  sensorValue = map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
  sensorValue = constrain(sensorValue, 0, 255);

  analogWrite(ledOutputPin, sensorValue);
}
```

### Using a Ultraviolet light sensor

Using a Ultraviolet light sensor to calculate the [UV index](https://www.epa.gov/sunsafety/uv-index-scale-0). This code is for [Grove - UV Sensor GUVA-S12D from Seed Studio](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-UV_Sensor/). According to the [schematics](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-UV_Sensor/res/Grove%20-%20UV%20Sensor%20v1.1sch.pdf) the formula to calculate UV Index is `((Vout * R2) / ((R1 + R2) * R3 * (10^-9)) - 83) / 21`.

In `setup` we initialize the Serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600, to print the UV Index. In a `for` loop we read the analog value from pin A0 1024 times then we get the mean value and assign it to `meanVal`. For the UV Index formula we need the sensor Vout, since the Arduino works at 5V and the analog value can range between 0 and 1023, we can convert the analog value to volts, multiplying the value by approximately 0,00489 (5 / 1023). We apply the formula and get the UV Index.

```c++
// UV Index formula ((Vout * R2) / ((R1 + R2) * R3 * (10^-9)) - 83) / 21
// R1 = 3300
// R2 = 1000
// R3 = 1000000

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue;
  long sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < 1024; i++) {
    sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
    sum = sensorValue + sum;
    delay(2);
  }

  long meanVal = sum / 1024;
  float sensorVout = meanVal * (5.0 / 1023.0);

  Serial.print("The current UV index is:");
  Serial.println((sensorVout * 1000 / 4.3 - 83) / 21);
  delay(20);
}
```

### Using the DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor

To read data from a DHT22, we can use the Adafruit DHT library. The following code is from Adafruit DHT library [example](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library/blob/master/examples/DHTtester/DHTtester.ino).

```c++
#include "DHT.h"

#define DHTPIN 2  // Digital pin connected to the DHT sensor

// Uncomment whatever type you're using!
//#define DHTTYPE DHT11   // DHT 11
#define DHTTYPE DHT22  // DHT 22  (AM2302), AM2321
//#define DHTTYPE DHT21   // DHT 21 (AM2301)


// Initialize DHT sensor.
DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println(F("DHTxx test!"));

  dht.begin();
}

void loop() {
  // Wait a few seconds between measurements.
  delay(5000);

  // Reading temperature or humidity takes about 250 milliseconds!
  // Sensor readings may also be up to 2 seconds 'old' (its a very slow sensor)
  float h = dht.readHumidity();
  // Read temperature as Celsius (the default)
  float t = dht.readTemperature();
  // Read temperature as Fahrenheit (isFahrenheit = true)
  float f = dht.readTemperature(true);

  // Check if any reads failed and exit early (to try again).
  if (isnan(h) || isnan(t) || isnan(f)) {
    Serial.println(F("Failed to read from DHT sensor!"));
    return;
  }

  // Compute heat index in Fahrenheit (the default)
  float hif = dht.computeHeatIndex(f, h);
  // Compute heat index in Celsius (isFahreheit = false)
  float hic = dht.computeHeatIndex(t, h, false);

  Serial.print(F("Humidity: "));
  Serial.print(h);
  Serial.print(F("%  Temperature: "));
  Serial.print(t);
  Serial.print(F("Â°C "));
  Serial.print(f);
  Serial.print(F("Â°F  Heat index: "));
  Serial.print(hic);
  Serial.print(F("Â°C "));
  Serial.print(hif);
  Serial.println(F("Â°F"));
}
```

### Using the Thermistor to measure temperature

In this code I use the [suoapvs/NTC_Thermistor](https://github.com/suoapvs/NTC_Thermistor) to get the thermistor temperature.

```c++
#include <Thermistor.h>
#include <NTC_Thermistor.h>

#define SENSOR_PIN A0
#define REFERENCE_RESISTANCE 9830
#define NOMINAL_RESISTANCE 10000
#define NOMINAL_TEMPERATURE 25
#define B_VALUE 4050

Thermistor* thermistor;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  thermistor = new NTC_Thermistor(
    SENSOR_PIN,
    REFERENCE_RESISTANCE,
    NOMINAL_RESISTANCE,
    NOMINAL_TEMPERATURE,
    B_VALUE);
}


void loop() {
  const double celsius = thermistor->readCelsius();
  const double kelvin = thermistor->readKelvin();
  const double fahrenheit = thermistor->readFahrenheit();

  Serial.print("Temperature: ");
  Serial.print(celsius);
  Serial.print(" C, ");
  Serial.print(kelvin);
  Serial.print(" K, ");
  Serial.print(fahrenheit);
  Serial.println(" F");

  delay(2000);
}
```
